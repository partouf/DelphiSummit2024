* It builds under Windows, now what!
* More choices; WSL, Docker, Linux cloud machine?
* Logging choices
* Metrics maybe?
* Time to make a CI/CD, but how?
* More CI/CD and unit-testing
* Deploying to the cloud, which one and how?
* What did we deploy, are we sure it's correct?
* Even more CI/CD
* More testing + API Testing
* Whereto next?

* Let's start somewhere - Build as Linux64.. oh wait, you're still on Win32?
