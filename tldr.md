* Delphi can cross-compile to Linux 64 bits, who knew!
* But does your application even build for Windows 64 bits?
* Wait, what are we making and why?
* What libraries can we use on Linux?
* Choices, choices, do we go for a CLI?
* It builds under Windows, now what!
* More choices; WSL, Docker, Linux cloud machine?
* Logging choices
* Metrics maybe?
* Time to make a CI/CD, but how?
* More CI/CD and unit-testing
* Deploying to the cloud, which one and how?
* What did we deploy, are we sure it's correct?
* Even more CI/CD
* More testing + API Testing
* Whereto next?
